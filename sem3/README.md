# Sem 3

The programs and algorithms inside this course starts it's array index from 1, even though it can help in memorising the content better, I don't like the idea of doing it when the C++ array index originally start's at 0, it's a bad practice and it's a waste of memory. Thus, the programs here will start from the index 0 and will end at n-1. LEARN THE LOGIC!

## DSA programs from the course
### Array Operations
1. [Traversal of an array](./traversal.cpp)
2. [Insertion of an element in an array](./insertion.cpp)
3. [Deletion of an element in an array](./deletion.cpp)
4. [Merging of two sorted arrays](./mergingSortedArrays.cpp)
#### Searching of Array Elements
5. [Linear Search](./linearSearch.cpp)
6. [Binary Search](./binarySearch.cpp) The array need's to be sorted
#### Sorting
7. [Selection Sort](./selectionSort.cpp)
