# Sem 3

The programs and algorithms inside this course starts it's array index from 1, even though it can help in memorising the content better, I don't like the idea of doing it when the C++ array index originally start's at 0, it's a bad practice and it's a waste of memory. Thus, the programs here will start from the index 0 and will end at n-1. LEARN THE LOGIC!

## DSA programs from the course
