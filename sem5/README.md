## Java Programming using Linux Record programs

1. [Write a Java program to find the number of and sum of all integers greater than 100 and less than 200 that are divisible by 7](./java/SumDivisibleBy7.java)

2. [Write a Java program to check whether a number is palindrome? Using Command Line arguments](./java/PalindromeCheck.java)

3. [Write a Java program to perform Constructor Overloading](./java/ConstructorOverloading.java)

4. [Write a Java program to calculate the volume of different objects using method overloading](./java/MethodOverloading.java)

5. [Write a program to implement a class called Square with a method area(double a) that finds the area of the square. A class Cube which is a subclass of Square and an overriding method area(double a) that finds the surface area(6a^2) of a cube](./java/MethodOverriding.java)

6. [Write a program to implement a class with a method to find the area of a rectangle and a subclass to find the volume of a rectangular shaped box](./java/Rectangle.java)

7. [Program to implement an abstract class Perfect with abstract method void special(int n).A subclass of this class be Square and implement the special(int n) that finds the numbers that are perfect squares from 1 to n](./java/AbstractDemo.java)

8. [Write a Java program to implement dynamic method dispatch](./java/TestPolymorphism.java)

9. [Create a class called Alpha with int x as instance variable, a constructor and a method alphaShow() to display x .Beta is a subclass of Alpha with with 2 intance variables float p and float q,a constructor and a method betaShow() to display p and q. (use superkeyword to invoke base class constructor)](./java/SuperDem.java)

10. [Program to implement an interface called Exam with a method pass(int mark) that returns a Boolean. Write another interface called Classify with a method Division(int average) which returns a string.Write a class called Result which implements both Exam and Classify.The pass() method should return true if the mark is greater than or equal to 50 else false.The Division() method must return “FIRST” when the parameter average is 60 or more, ”SECOND” when average is 50 or more but below 60, “NO DIVISION” when average is less than 50.](./java/ExamInterface.java)
