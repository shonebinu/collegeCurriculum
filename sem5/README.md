8.  [Write a Java program to implement dynamic method dispatch](./java/TestPolymorphism.java)

9.  [Create a class called Alpha with int x as instance variable, a constructor and a method alphaShow() to display x .Beta is a subclass of Alpha with with 2 intance variables float p and float q,a constructor and a method betaShow() to display p and q. (use superkeyword to invoke base class constructor)](./java/SuperDem.java)

10. [Program to implement an interface called Exam with a method pass(int mark) that returns a Boolean. Write another interface called Classify with a method Division(int average) which returns a string.Write a class called Result which implements both Exam and Classify.The pass() method should return true if the mark is greater than or equal to 50 else false.The Division() method must return “FIRST” when the parameter average is 60 or more, ”SECOND” when average is 50 or more but below 60, “NO DIVISION” when average is less than 50](./java/ExamInterface.java)

    iii) to find the tranpose of the matix

16. [Program to create a package named shapes and define abstract class Shape inside it. The Shape class should have an abstract method getArea(). Define two subclasses Rectangle and Circle that extends the Shape class and implements the getArea() method. Create a class FindArea in a different package and use the Rectangle and Circle classes to find the areas of a reactangle and a circle](./java/shapeDemo)

    ```bash
    javac shapes/Shape.java
    javac shapes/Rectangle.java
    javac shapes/Circle.java
    javac finalpack/FindArea.java

    java finalpack/FindArea
